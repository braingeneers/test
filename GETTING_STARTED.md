# Getting Started

This is a guide to help you get started with the Braingeneers Python Research Template. This template is designed to help you get started with your own research project. It is designed to be flexible and modular, so that you can easily add new features and functionality as you need it.

## Using Codespaces

The easiest way to get started is to use GitHub Codespaces. This will allow you to run the code in the cloud, without having to install anything on your computer. To get started, click the green "Code" button at the top of this page, and select "Open with Codespaces". This will open a new Codespace for you, and you can start working right away.

### Open with Codespaces

Inside of the `README.md` file, you will find a link to open the project in Codespaces. Clicking this link will open a new Codespace for you, and you can start working right away. To update the repo name connected to the "Open with Codespaces" button, you will need to update the `README.md` code.

```md
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/braingeneers/<project_name>?quickstart=1)
```

For example:

```md
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/braingeneers/python-research-template?quickstart=1)
```

Review the [Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace-using-a-template-repository) for more information.

### Customize Codespace

To change the name of your Codespace, click the "Customize" button in the bottom left corner of the screen.

## Running Locally

If you want to run the code locally, you will need to install Python 3.7 or higher. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You will also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't already have it.
